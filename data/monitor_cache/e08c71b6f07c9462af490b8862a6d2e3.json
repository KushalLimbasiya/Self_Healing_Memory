Anomaly detected: False. There does not seem to be any significant deviation from the historical memory usage pattern.\n2. Severity: Normal. The current memory usage is within expected limits and does not pose an immediate threat to system performance or stability.\n3. Detailed description of any issues detected: None. No anomalies or issues were found based on the provided memory statistics and historical context.\n4. Specific recommendations for addressing the issues: None. No actions are required at this time as there are no detected anomalies or issues.\n5. Patterns observed in memory usage over time:\n   - Memory usage remains relatively stable over time.\n   - There are minor fluctuations in available memory but they do not seem to impact overall system performance.\n\nNote: This analysis assumes that the provided data is accurate and representative of the actual memory usage on the system. Additional monitoring and analysis may be necessary to confirm these findings and ensure that the system continues to operate optimally."}
