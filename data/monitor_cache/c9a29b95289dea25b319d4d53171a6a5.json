Analyze the following memory statistics and determine if there are any anomalies, potential issues, or patterns that should be addressed.\n            \n            Current Memory Statistics:\n            {\n  \"total\": 25463480320,\n  \"available\": 11638194176,\n  \"used\": 13825286144,\n  \"used_percent\": 54,\n  \"timestamp\": \"2025-04-16T06:04:32.635978\"\n}\n            \n            Historical Context (previous memory events):\n            []\n            \n            Provide a detailed analysis including:\n            1. Is there an anomaly? (true/false)\n            2. What is the severity? (normal/low/moderate/high/critical)\n            3. Detailed description of any issues detected\n            4. Specific recommendations for addressing the issues\n            5. Patterns observed in memory usage over time\n            \n            Format your response as a JSON object with the following fields:\n            - anomaly_detected (boolean)\n            - severity (string)\n            - anomaly_description (string, null if no anomaly)\n            - recommendations (list of strings)\n            - patterns_observed (list of strings)\n            ", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 1024, "response": "{\n  \"anomaly_detected\": false,\n  \"severity\": \"normal\",\n  \"anomaly_description\": null,\n  \"recommendations\": [\n    \"Continue monitoring memory usage to detect any sudden changes or trends.\"\n  ],\n  \"patterns_observed\": [\n    \"Currently, approximately 54% of the total memory is being used, which is within a typical range for many systems.\"\n  ]\n}\n\nAdditional notes:\n\n1. There are no anomalies detected in the current memory statistics as the used_percent is within a common range for many systems (around 50-70%).\n2. The severity level is considered normal since the available memory is still relatively high (over 11 GB), and there are no signs of an immediate risk of running out of memory.\n3. Recommendations include continuing to monitor memory usage to detect any sudden changes or trends that could indicate potential issues in the future. Additionally, ensure that there are no memory leaks in the system or applications.\n4. Since there is no historical context provided, it's not possible to identify patterns observed over time. However, based on the current snapshot, memory usage appears to be stable and within normal parameters.\n\nPlease note that this analysis is based on the information provided and might require further investigation if additional context becomes available."}
