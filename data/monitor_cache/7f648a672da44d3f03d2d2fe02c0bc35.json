Anomaly: No anomaly was detected in the provided memory statistics. The used memory percentage has been fairly consistent, fluctuating between 55% and 56%.\n\n2. Severity: The severity level is considered \"normal\" as there are no significant deviations or abnormal patterns in the memory usage.\n\n3. Detailed description of any issues detected: None. The memory usage appears to be within normal operating parameters.\n\n4. Recommendations: No specific recommendations are needed at this time since the memory usage is stable and within normal limits.\n\n5. Patterns observed in memory usage over time:\n   - Memory usage has remained relatively stable over the observed period, fluctuating between 55% and 56%.\n   - There is a slight decrease in used memory every minute, but it remains within the normal range.\n\nThis analysis is based on the provided memory statistics and historical context. Continuous monitoring is recommended to ensure memory usage remains at acceptable levels and to detect any potential issues that may arise in the future."}
