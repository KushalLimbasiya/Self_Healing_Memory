Anomaly Detection: No significant anomalies have been detected in the provided memory statistics. The changes in memory usage are within expected ranges for typical system operation.\n\n2. Severity Level: The current severity level is classified as \"normal\". The used_percent value of 50% falls within the acceptable range, and there are no sudden spikes or drops in memory usage that could indicate a critical issue.\n\n3. Detailed Description of Detected Issues: None. No issues or anomalies have been detected in the memory usage statistics.\n\n4. Recommendations: \n   - Continue monitoring memory usage to ensure it remains stable and within acceptable limits.\n   - Investigate any applications or processes that may be contributing to increased memory usage if the trend continues or worsens.\n\n5. Patterns Observed in Memory Usage Over Time:\n   - Memory usage has been fluctuating between 44% and 51% over the past few minutes, indicating typical system operation.\n   - The current memory usage is at 50%, which is within the normal range and does not require immediate action.\n\nConfidence: 95%"}
