There is no clear anomaly detected in the memory usage statistics as the changes are gradual and within a reasonable range.\n2. The severity level is considered normal since the used_percent remains below 60% and there are no sudden drops or spikes in memory usage.\n3. No specific issues have been detected that require immediate attention.\n4. Recommendations at this time would be to continue monitoring memory usage to ensure it does not exceed recommended thresholds (typically around 70-75%). If memory usage consistently trends upward, consider optimizing applications or increasing available memory resources.\n5. Observed patterns include a steady decrease in available memory and a corresponding increase in used_percent over time. This could indicate normal system operation or potential memory leaks in applications. Further analysis and monitoring may be necessary to determine the cause."}
