Is there an anomaly? (true/false)\n   - False. There are no sudden spikes or drops in memory usage that would indicate an anomaly.\n\n2. What is the severity? (normal/low/moderate/high/critical)\n   - Normal. The used memory percentage remains around 60%, which is not alarmingly high.\n\n3. Detailed description of any issues detected\n   - None. No issues have been detected based on the provided memory statistics.\n\n4. Specific recommendations for addressing the issues\n   - None. No issues have been detected, so no recommendations are needed at this time.\n\n5. Patterns observed in memory usage over time\n   - Memory usage has remained relatively stable over the observed period.\n   - There is a slight downward trend in available memory every 3 minutes, which might be worth monitoring to ensure it does not continue decreasing significantly.\n   - Used memory fluctuates around 60% of total memory, indicating consistent usage patterns."}
