Anomaly: There is no significant anomaly in the memory usage statistics provided. The used memory percentage has remained relatively stable, fluctuating only between 54% and 55%.\n2. Severity: The severity level is normal, as there are no major deviations or concerning patterns in the memory usage data.\n3. Anomaly description: N/A (No anomaly detected)\n4. Recommendations: No specific recommendations are necessary at this time, as the memory usage appears to be within normal limits and no anomalies have been detected. Regular monitoring should continue to ensure that memory usage remains stable and within acceptable levels.\n5. Patterns observed: Memory usage has remained relatively stable over the observed period. Used memory percentage fluctuates between 54% and 55%, which is within a normal range. There are no noticeable trends indicating increasing or decreasing memory usage over time."}
