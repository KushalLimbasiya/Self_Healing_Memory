Memory usage has been fluctuating between 55% and 56% over the past 10 minutes, which is within a normal range for many systems. The available memory has been decreasing slightly, but is still above 11 GB, indicating that there is still a significant amount of memory available for use.\n\nBased on this analysis, the severity of the current memory usage is considered normal. There are no specific recommendations beyond continuously monitoring memory usage to ensure it remains at acceptable levels.\n\nIt is worth noting that memory usage patterns can vary greatly depending on the specific workload and configuration of the system. Therefore, it is important to establish a baseline for normal memory usage on this system and to continuously monitor usage to detect any deviations from this baseline. If memory usage continues to increase or if it consistently approaches or exceeds 80%, further investigation may be warranted to identify any potential issues or performance bottlenecks."}
