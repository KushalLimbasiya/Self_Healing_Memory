Anomaly detected: No significant anomalies were detected in the memory usage statistics provided. The used_percent value has remained relatively stable around 54-55%.\n2. Severity: Normal. The current memory usage does not indicate any critical issues or anomalies.\n3. Detailed description of any issues detected: N/A (No issues detected)\n4. Specific recommendations for addressing the issues: None at this time, as no critical issues or anomalies have been detected.\n5. Patterns observed in memory usage over time:\n   a. Memory usage has been consistently around 54-55% for the last few minutes, indicating a stable memory usage pattern.\n   b. There is a slight decrease in used memory and increase in available memory over time, suggesting possible memory release or optimization by processes.\n\nConfidence: 95%"}
