Anomaly: No, there is no anomaly detected based on the current and historical memory statistics provided. The used_percent value remains within a relatively small range of 49-51%.\n2. Severity: Normal. The memory usage is within expected levels and does not indicate any critical or severe issues.\n3. Anomaly Description: N/A (No anomaly detected).\n4. Recommendations:\n   a. Continue monitoring memory usage to ensure it remains stable and within acceptable levels.\n   b. Investigate any recent changes in the system that could contribute to the observed decrease in available memory, such as new applications or services, updates, or configuration changes.\n5. Patterns Observed:\n   a. Memory usage has been fluctuating between 49% and 51% over the past few minutes, indicating a relatively stable memory utilization pattern.\n   b. The amount of available memory has decreased by approximately 366 MB in the last 13 minutes, which may be a normal pattern if it corresponds to regular system activity or could indicate a slowly increasing memory usage trend that should be monitored.\n\nPlease note that the provided analysis is based on the limited data available and further investigation might be necessary to fully understand the memory usage patterns and identify any potential issues."}
