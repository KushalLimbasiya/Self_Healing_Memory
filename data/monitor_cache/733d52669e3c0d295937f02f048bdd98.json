Is there an anomaly? (true/false)\n   - False. No significant anomalies were detected in the memory usage statistics. The used_percent value has remained relatively stable, with a minor increase of around 2% in the last 10 minutes.\n\n2. What is the severity? (normal/low/moderate/high/critical)\n   - Normal. The current memory usage is within expected limits and does not pose an immediate risk to system performance or stability.\n\n3. Detailed description of any issues detected\n   - None. No significant issues or anomalies were detected in the memory usage statistics.\n\n4. Specific recommendations for addressing the issues\n   - None. No issues or anomalies were detected, so no recommendations are necessary at this time.\n\n5. Patterns observed in memory usage over time\n   - Memory usage has been stable around 52-54% for the past 25 minutes.\n   - A slight increase in used memory (approximately 500 MB) was observed in the last 10 minutes. This could be due to normal system operation or the launch of new processes. Monitor memory usage to ensure that it remains within acceptable limits and does not cause performance degradation or system instability."}
