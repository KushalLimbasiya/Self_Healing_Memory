Is there an anomaly? (true/false)\n   - False. There is no significant or unexpected change in memory usage that can be considered an anomaly.\n\n2. What is the severity? (normal/low/moderate/high/critical)\n   - Normal. The current memory usage falls within acceptable levels, and there are no indications of potential issues.\n\n3. Detailed description of any issues detected\n   - None. No issues have been detected in the provided memory statistics.\n\n4. Specific recommendations for addressing the issues\n   - None. As no issues have been detected, there are no specific recommendations to address any problems at this time.\n\n5. Patterns observed in memory usage over time\n   - Memory usage has been relatively stable over the observed period, fluctuating between 49% and 55% usage.\n   - There has been a decrease in used memory from 14135779328 bytes to 12658864128 bytes, resulting in an increase in available memory from 11327700992 bytes to 12804616192 bytes. This pattern could indicate that previously running processes have completed or been terminated, freeing up memory resources.\n\nIt is essential to continue monitoring memory usage patterns to ensure that they remain within acceptable levels and to detect any potential issues early on."}
