Anomaly: False - There are no significant deviations or sudden changes in memory usage that would indicate an anomaly.\n2. Severity: Normal - The current memory usage is within expected levels and does not pose any immediate risk.\n3. Detailed description of any issues detected: None - No issues were detected in the provided memory statistics.\n4. Recommendations: None - No actions are required at this time as the memory usage is stable and within normal limits.\n5. Patterns observed in memory usage over time:\n   - Memory usage has been consistently around 56% for the past few minutes, indicating a steady state.\n   - Available memory has been fluctuating between approximately 11.1 GB and 11.4 GB, which may be due to normal system operations such as process creation and termination or memory management activities like garbage collection.\n\nConfidence level: 95%"}
