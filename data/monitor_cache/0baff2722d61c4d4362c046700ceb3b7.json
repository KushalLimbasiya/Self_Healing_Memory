Anomaly detection: No anomalies have been detected in the provided memory statistics. The usage has remained stable around 51-52% without any significant fluctuations or sudden changes.\n\n2. Severity: The current memory usage situation is classified as \"normal\" since there are no apparent anomalies or issues that could potentially impact system performance.\n\n3. Anomaly description: N/A (No anomaly detected)\n\n4. Recommendations: In the absence of any detected anomalies or issues, no specific recommendations are necessary at this time. Regular monitoring of memory usage and system performance is still advised to ensure optimal operation.\n\n5. Patterns observed:\n   - Memory usage has been relatively stable around 51-52% over the past 15 minutes.\n   - There was a slight decrease in available memory from 12643540992 bytes to 12210749440 bytes during this period. This decrease is not significant enough to raise concerns but should still be monitored to ensure it does not continue to decrease steadily.\n\nConfidence: 95%"}
