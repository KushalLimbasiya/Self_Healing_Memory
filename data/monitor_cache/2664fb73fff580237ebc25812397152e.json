There doesn't seem to be any significant anomaly in the memory usage statistics provided.\n2. The severity level is considered normal, as the used_percent remains below 50% and there are no drastic changes in memory usage.\n3. No specific issues have been detected that require immediate attention.\n4. As there are no critical issues detected, no recommendations are provided at this time. However, it is advisable to monitor memory usage trends to ensure they remain within acceptable limits.\n5. Patterns observed in memory usage over time include stable total memory and a slight decrease in available memory, which may suggest increased memory utilization by processes over time. This pattern should be monitored to ensure it does not lead to potential memory-related issues in the future."}
