Anomaly detected: False. There are no significant deviations from the historical context that would indicate an anomaly.\n2. Severity: Normal. The memory usage is within expected ranges and there is no indication of any issues.\n3. Anomaly description: N/A (No anomaly detected)\n4. Recommendations: None at this time. The system's memory usage is stable and no action is required.\n5. Patterns observed:\n   - Memory usage has been fluctuating between 49% and 50% over the observed period, indicating normal operation.\n   - Available memory has been decreasing slightly, but remains above 50% of total memory, which is still a healthy level of available memory for the system.\n\nThis analysis is based on the provided memory statistics and historical context. If additional data or context becomes available, this assessment may need to be revised."}
