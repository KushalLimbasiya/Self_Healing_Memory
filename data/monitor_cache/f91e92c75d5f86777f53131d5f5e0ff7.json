Is there an anomaly? (true/false)\n   - False\n\n2. What is the severity? (normal/low/moderate/high/critical)\n   - Normal\n\n3. Detailed description of any issues detected\n   - None detected at this time. Memory usage is stable and within expected ranges.\n\n4. Specific recommendations for addressing the issues\n   - None at this time. Continue monitoring memory usage and investigate if the decreasing available memory trend continues or becomes more pronounced.\n\n5. Patterns observed in memory usage over time\n   - Total memory remains constant at 25463480320 bytes.\n   - Used memory percentage fluctuates around 60%.\n   - Available memory has been decreasing gradually in the last few observations, from approximately 1.02 GB to 1.00 GB. This decrease is not significant enough to warrant immediate action, but it should be monitored to ensure it does not continue to decrease rapidly."}
