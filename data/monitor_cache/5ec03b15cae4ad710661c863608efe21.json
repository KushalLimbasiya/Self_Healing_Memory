Anomaly detected: False\n\nNo anomalies have been detected in the memory usage data provided. The used_percent has remained consistent at 49%.\n\n2. Severity: Normal\n\nThere are no critical, high, moderate, or low severity issues detected based on the memory usage data.\n\n3. Anomaly description: None\n\nAs there are no detected anomalies, no description is needed.\n\n4. Recommendations:\n\nSince no critical issues have been found, there are no specific recommendations at this time. Continue monitoring memory usage to ensure it remains within acceptable levels.\n\n5. Patterns observed in memory usage over time:\n- Memory usage remains relatively stable around 49% utilization.\n- Available memory has been fluctuating slightly but remains above 120 GB.\n\nOverall, memory usage appears to be normal and stable based on the provided data. Continue to monitor memory usage trends and investigate further if any anomalies or issues arise in the future."}
