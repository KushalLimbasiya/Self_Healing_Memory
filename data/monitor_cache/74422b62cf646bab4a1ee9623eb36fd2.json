The severity level is normal, and no recommendations are needed at this time. The patterns observed include a decrease in used memory and an increase in available memory over the past 30 minutes, with the used memory percentage fluctuating around 50% before dropping to 44%. This could be due to normal system processes or applications releasing memory as they finish their tasks. Monitoring should continue to ensure that memory usage remains at acceptable levels and does not indicate any potential issues in the future."}
