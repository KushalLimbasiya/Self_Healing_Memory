Is there an anomaly? (true/false)\n   - False. The available memory has been fluctuating within a small range, and the used_percent has remained around 56%, which does not indicate any sudden spikes or abnormal drops in memory usage.\n\n2. What is the severity? (normal/low/moderate/high/critical)\n   - Normal. The current memory usage and historical context do not suggest any severe memory-related issues.\n\n3. Detailed description of any issues detected\n   - None. There are no apparent memory issues based on the provided data.\n\n4. Specific recommendations for addressing the issues\n   - None. As there are no detected anomalies or issues, no recommendations are necessary at this time.\n\n5. Patterns observed in memory usage over time\n   - Memory usage has been relatively stable over the observed period, fluctuating between 55% and 56%. This pattern suggests that memory usage is consistent and not exhibiting any concerning trends."}
