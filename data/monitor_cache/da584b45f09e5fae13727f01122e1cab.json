Analyze the following memory statistics and determine if there are any anomalies, potential issues, or patterns that should be addressed.\n            \n            Current Memory Statistics:\n            {\n  \"total\": 25463480320,\n  \"available\": 10256322560,\n  \"used\": 15207157760,\n  \"used_percent\": 59,\n  \"timestamp\": \"2025-04-16T06:48:51.952287\"\n}\n            \n            Historical Context (previous memory events):\n            []\n            \n            Provide a detailed analysis including:\n            1. Is there an anomaly? (true/false)\n            2. What is the severity? (normal/low/moderate/high/critical)\n            3. Detailed description of any issues detected\n            4. Specific recommendations for addressing the issues\n            5. Patterns observed in memory usage over time\n            \n            Format your response as a JSON object with the following fields:\n            - anomaly_detected (boolean)\n            - severity (string)\n            - anomaly_description (string, null if no anomaly)\n            - recommendations (list of strings)\n            - patterns_observed (list of strings)\n            ", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 1024, "response": "{\n  \"anomaly_detected\": false,\n  \"severity\": \"normal\",\n  \"anomaly_description\": null,\n  \"recommendations\": [\n    \"Monitor memory usage regularly to identify any potential future issues.\"\n  ],\n  \"patterns_observed\": [\n    \"The current memory usage is within normal parameters, with 59% of total memory being used.\"\n  ]\n}\n\nDetailed Explanation:\n\n1. Anomaly detected: False. Based on the provided memory statistics, there does not appear to be an anomaly as the used_percent value (59%) falls within acceptable ranges for many systems.\n\n2. Severity: Normal. Given that no anomaly has been detected and the used_percent value is not nearing any critical thresholds, the severity level is considered normal.\n\n3. Anomaly description: N/A. Since no anomaly was detected, there is no need for an anomaly description.\n\n4. Recommendations:\n   a. Monitor memory usage regularly to identify any potential future issues. This can help in proactively addressing any concerns before they become critical.\n\n5. Patterns observed:\n   a. The current memory usage is within normal parameters, with 59% of total memory being used. This pattern suggests that the system is operating under typical conditions.\n\nPlease note that without historical context, it is difficult to determine long-term patterns or trends in memory usage. To better analyze memory usage over time, consider providing historical memory event data."}
