However, based on the current used_percent value of 50%, I predict a slight increase in memory usage for both 1 hour and 24 hours. This assumption is made considering typical fluctuations in memory usage patterns.\n\nAs for potential issues, there is a medium severity risk of memory shortage within the next 24 hours if usage continues to increase at the same rate or faster. The probability of this issue is estimated to be 0.6.\n\nRecommended actions include monitoring memory usage closely, identifying and terminating unnecessary processes, and considering adding more memory to the system if usage consistently remains high.\n\nThe confidence score is 0.7, reflecting the uncertainty associated with predictions made without historical data."}
