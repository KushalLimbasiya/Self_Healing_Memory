Based on this trend, it is predicted that memory usage will continue to rise, reaching approximately 68% in the next hour and 74% within the next 24 hours.\n\nPotential issues include system instability and possible crashes or failures due to low available memory. These issues are considered high and critical severity, respectively, with a probability of 0.8 and 0.6, and are expected to occur within the next 24 hours.\n\nRecommended actions include monitoring memory usage closely, reducing the number of running applications or processes, adding more memory to the system, and checking for and resolving any memory leaks. This prediction is highly confident, with a confidence score of 0.9."}
