However, this is still higher than the average usage, and considering the anomalies that have occurred, it's possible that usage could spike again in the future. Therefore, I predict that memory usage will continue to decrease slightly over the next hour, but will start to rise again over the next 24 hours, potentially leading to a memory shortage.\n\nThe intermittent anomalies in memory usage could be caused by a variety of factors, such as background processes or software bugs. It's recommended to investigate the cause of these anomalies in order to prevent any potential issues. Additionally, freeing up memory by deleting temporary files or optimizing processes could help alleviate any memory shortages.\n\nThe confidence score of 0.85 reflects my moderate confidence in these predictions, as there is still some uncertainty due to the anomalies in the historical data."}
