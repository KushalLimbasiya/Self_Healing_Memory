In the past hour, used memory percentage has risen from 49% to 52%. If this trend continues, I predict that memory usage will reach approximately 53% in the next hour and 55% in the next 24 hours.\n\nOne potential issue that may arise is a memory shortage due to the steady increase in memory usage. The probability of this issue occurring is estimated to be 60%, and it may become a problem within the next 24 hours if memory usage continues to grow at its current rate.\n\nTo prevent potential memory-related issues, I recommend closely monitoring memory usage for any sudden spikes. Additionally, identifying and optimizing memory-intensive processes can help reduce overall memory consumption. If memory usage consistently remains high, consider increasing the system's available memory to ensure adequate resources for all processes.\n\nMy confidence in this prediction is 85%, as the historical data shows a clear trend of increasing memory usage. However, please note that unexpected events or changes in system behavior could affect future memory conditions."}
