In the past hour, used_percent has gone from 62 to 71. If this trend continues, it is predicted that memory usage will reach approximately 74% within the next hour and 82% within the next 24 hours.\n\nBased on these predictions, there are several potential issues that could arise. First, with memory usage approaching 80%, there is a high probability of system instability due to insufficient memory. Additionally, even before reaching this threshold, increased memory usage can lead to decreased performance.\n\nTo prevent these issues, it is recommended to monitor memory usage closely and identify any processes that are consuming large amounts of memory. If possible, consider adding additional memory to the system. It may also be beneficial to optimize memory-intensive processes or configure them to use less memory. Finally, schedule a maintenance window to investigate and resolve any memory-related issues. The confidence score for these predictions is 0.85, indicating a relatively high degree of certainty."}
