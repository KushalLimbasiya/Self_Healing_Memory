# Self-Healing Memory System

## Overview

The Self-Healing Memory System is an advanced memory management solution that employs AI-powered agents to monitor, predict, and automatically resolve memory issues before they impact system performance. The architecture combines a high-performance Rust core with intelligent Python agents and a vector database to create a comprehensive memory management ecosystem.

## Architecture

### System Components

![System Architecture]

The system consists of four primary components working in harmony:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Memory Core** | Rust-based foundation providing low-level memory operations |
| **Agent System** | Python-based intelligent agents for analysis and remediation |
| **Vector Database** | ChromaDB storage for memory logs, analyses, and actions |
| **RAG Pipeline** | Retrieval-augmented generation system enabling context-aware decisions |

### Memory Core (Rust)

The Rust-based memory core delivers high-performance memory management:

- Real-time memory statistics collection
- Efficient allocation and deallocation operations
- Advanced defragmentation capabilities
- Memory usage pattern simulation

### Agent System

Three specialized AI agents form the system's intelligence layer:

1. **Monitor Agent**: Analyzes current memory conditions and detects anomalies
2. **Predictor Agent**: Forecasts potential memory issues based on historical data
3. **Healer Agent**: Implements corrective actions to resolve identified problems

Each agent utilizes its own instance of Mistral AI models and operates independently while sharing information through the vector database.

### Vector Database Implementation

The system leverages ChromaDB for efficient storage and retrieval of:

- Memory event logs with semantic embeddings
- Agent analyses and insights
- Historical healing actions and their outcomes
- Prediction data with confidence scores

## Agent Capabilities

### Monitor Agent

The Monitor Agent continuously analyzes the memory environment to identify potential issues.

**Capabilities:**
- Real-time memory usage pattern detection
- Anomaly identification using statistical and AI methods
- Semantic analysis of memory allocation patterns
- Detailed memory status reporting

**Technical Implementation:**
```python
# Monitor Agent initialization
monitor = MemoryMonitorAgent(mistral_api_key=os.environ["MISTRAL_API_KEY_MONITOR"])

# Start continuous monitoring
monitor.start_monitoring(interval=60)  # 60-second intervals
```

### Predictor Agent

The Predictor Agent leverages historical data to forecast future memory conditions.

**Capabilities:**
- Time-series analysis of memory usage trends
- Early warning detection for potential issues
- Confidence-scored predictions with specific timeframes
- Actionable recommendations based on predicted outcomes

**Technical Implementation:**
```python
# Retrieve memory statistics and generate prediction
stats = predictor.retrieve_memory_stats()
prediction = predictor.predict_memory_condition(stats)

# Access prediction components
issue_probability = prediction['probability']
estimated_timeframe = prediction['timeframe']
recommended_actions = prediction['recommendations']
```

### Healer Agent

The Healer Agent implements corrective measures to resolve memory issues.

**Capabilities:**
- Memory defragmentation strategy generation
- Process termination recommendations
- Memory reallocation planning
- Memory leak identification and remediation

**Technical Implementation:**
```python
# Generate healing plan based on current conditions
healing_plan = healer.generate_healing_plan(memory_stats)

# Execute healing actions
results = healer.execute_actions(healing_plan['actions'])

# Validate healing effectiveness
validation = healer.validate_healing_results(results)
```

## RAG Pipeline

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline enables context-aware decision making:

- Embeds memory logs using SentenceTransformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- Stores embeddings in separate ChromaDB collections for each agent
- Provides semantic search capabilities for relevant historical data
- Supports both batch processing and real-time streaming

## Data Flow

1. **Collection**: The Rust core collects memory statistics and writes to `memory_events.jsonl`
2. **Processing**: The RAG pipeline processes logs into vector embeddings
3. **Analysis**: The Monitor Agent analyzes current conditions
4. **Prediction**: The Predictor Agent forecasts potential issues
5. **Remediation**: The Healer Agent implements corrective actions

### Configuration

Configure the system using environment variables:

```
MISTRAL_API_KEY_MONITOR=your_monitor_key
MISTRAL_API_KEY_HEALER=your_healer_key
MISTRAL_API_KEY_PREDICTOR=your_predictor_key
MISTRAL_API_KEY_EXPLAINER=your_explainer_key
```

### Threading Model

The system operates using a multi-threaded architecture:

- Each agent runs in a dedicated thread
- The RAG pipeline processes data in a separate thread
- Thread synchronization prevents race conditions
- Event-driven communication between components

## Usage Examples

### Basic System Initialization

```python
from app.monitor_agent import MemoryMonitorAgent
from app.predictor_agent import MemoryPredictorAgent
from app.healer_agent import MemoryHealerAgent

# Initialize agents
monitor = MemoryMonitorAgent()
predictor = MemoryPredictorAgent()
healer = MemoryHealerAgent()

# Start the system
monitor.start_monitoring()
predictor.start_prediction_service()
healer.start_healing_service()
```

### Handling Critical Memory Conditions

```python
# Detect critical memory condition
if monitor.is_memory_critical():
    # Generate immediate healing plan
    urgent_plan = healer.generate_urgent_healing_plan()
    
    # Execute high-priority actions
    results = healer.execute_priority_actions(urgent_plan)
    
    # Log outcomes
    monitor.log_healing_results(results)
```

The system is optimized for minimal resource usage:

- LLM requests are cached to reduce API calls
- Vector search operations use approximate nearest neighbors
- Rust core operations are optimized for speed

Planned enhancements include:

1. Integration with container orchestration systems
2. Distributed memory management across clusters
3. Enhanced visualization dashboard
4. Reinforcement learning for healing strategy optimization
5. Extended support for specialized memory architectures

## Requirements
