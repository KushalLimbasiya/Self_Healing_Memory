## 🔍 Overview

**Self-Healing Memory (SHM)** is an experimental framework designed to simulate a cognitive, autonomous memory system for AI agents. Inspired by biological memory, this system can **detect, correct, and evolve its knowledge** using:

- 🧠 LLM Agents (CrewAI)
- 🔁 Feedback Loops
- 📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- ⚙️ Modular Task Architecture
- 💾 Real-time embedded memory

The system learns from its own **mistakes and feedback**, just like humans — allowing autonomous agents to **self-correct**, **refactor their thoughts**, and **improve task execution** over time.

### 🔧 Key Agents

* **MonitorAgent** – Detects faults, memory conflicts, or hallucinations.
* **HealerAgent** – Corrects inaccurate memory blocks using LLM and context.
* **PredictorAgent** – Forecasts future issues based on current memory state.
* **ExplainerAgent** – Explains why a correction was made, ensuring transparency.
